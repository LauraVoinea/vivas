  \begin{alertblock}{StMungo Background}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Java-based tool developed at the University of Glasgow
    \item translates a Scribble local protocol to a Mungo specification and skeleton socket-based implementation code
  \end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}


\begin{alertblock}{Development}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Additional Scribble constructs: no payload, multiple payload, messages without a signature, annotated payloads \hfill  \textit{year 1}
    \item Various convenience features \hfill  \textit{year 1}
    \item Special cases of recursion and choice \hfill  \textit{year 1}
    \item Collaborated with Florian Weber on a plug-in for mapping between concrete and abstract messages from Scribble to the `real-world' representation
    \hfill  \textit{year 2}
    \item Translate inlined protocols and sub-protocols \hfill  \textit{ongoing}
    \item Keep up to date with in Scribble and Mungo \hfill  \textit{ongoing}

  \end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Further Development}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Support more complex constructs such as interruptible or parallel
\end{enumerate}
