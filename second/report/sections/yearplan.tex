\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Some of the future work planned has been highlighted throughout this report. The activities planed for next year fall into several interconnected themes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Language usability and evaluation. As mentioned above in \ref{us} a user study is in plan for the near future, its results to be analysed and written up.


\item Tool development. Some of the work that is to be done has already been discussed earlier, however it is expected that the need for various different improvements will arise. Thus this will be an ongoing activity through the year.


\item Training and development. This category contains any training courses required by the school as well as any academic events to be attended. Over the summer, I will attend BETTY (Behavioural Types for Reliable Large-Scale Software Systems) in Limassol, Cyprus. The summer school will cover closely related areas of interest such as multiparty session types, linear logic, Practical programming with session types. In September I will help with the PPDP, LOPSTR and SAS conferences in Edinburgh.

\item Refining initial research objectives and questions. This is really the miscellaneous category, containing work to be continued such as the usecases\ref{usecases}, and any new ideas that will arise from the user study.
\end{itemize}

For a detailed plan, a Ganntt chart is available in appendix \ref{appendix:gantt}.
