% \begin{frame}\frametitle{Conclusion}
% \begin{itemize}
%   % \item Session Types are a very simple but powerful formalism to model protocols in distributed systems
%   \item Plenty of scope to study the impact of session type design
%   \item Many interesting questions
%
%   \item different tools and implementations for the same language with no comparison between them
% \end{itemize}
%
% \textbf{Goal:} Improve session types by identifying which designs and implementations help or hinder programmers
