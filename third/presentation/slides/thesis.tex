    Data types and typing theories have proved to be essential for sequential computation. The session control and discipline that session types provide are  similarly important for concurrent, distributed programming. To further incorporate session typing in practical settings, we must be able to express subtle and complex protocols and make safety guarantees. While providing strong guarantees, linearity is often an obstacle for expressivity. Specifying protocols without the full cost of linearity, without sacrificing safety would be highly beneficial.
