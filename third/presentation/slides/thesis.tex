  \begin{alertblock}{Thesis Statement}
    Session types are a useful addition to the syntax and semantics of modern languages. Programming with session types and the constraints that this comes with i.e. linearity can be understood and used by real world programmers.

    Moreover session types can help programmers understand the problem they are tying to solve with more ease and structure their code better.

    Session typed languages provide useful additional safeguards and diagnostic information that lead to a system with the expected behaviour with less effort.
