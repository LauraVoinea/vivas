abstract="In prior work we proposed an interpretation of intuitionistic linear logic propositions as session types for concurrent processes. The type system obtained from the interpretation ensures fundamental properties of session-based typed disciplines---most notably, type preservation, session fidelity, and global progress. In this paper, we complement and strengthen these results by developing a theory of logical relations. Our development is based on, and is remarkably similar to, that for functional languages, extended to an (intuitionistic) linear type structure. A main result is that well-typed processes always terminate (strong normalization). We also introduce a notion of observational equivalence for session-typed processes. As applications, we prove that all proof conversions induced by the logic interpretation actually express observational equivalences, and explain how type isomorphisms resulting from linear logic equivalences are realized by coercions between interface types of session-based concurrent systems.",
