\section{Work Undertaken}
\label{Research}
%
% In the past year I have largely hit the goals agreed upon at the
% last annual review, an overview of which I present here. Some items, remained on hold, while other research problems appeared.

Over the past year the focus of my research has shifted to a more theoretical one. As such, some of the goals stated last year have been met, while others have been superseded by new ones. An overview of which I present here.

\subsection{Modular linearity}
\label{sub:modlinearity}
Existing work typically assumes linear type systems as necessary for session types. In order to maintain session fidelity and ensure that all communication actions in a session type occur, session type systems typically require that endpoints are used linearly: each endpoint must be used exactly once.
This work sets out to investigate whether linear types are necessary to provide resource control/ownership for session types; what are the characteristics necessary to assure session fidelity; what other semantic properties should/might be guaranteed; how can more general approaches to resource control/ownership be integrated with session types.

The $pi$-calculus with session types has been chosen as a suitable starting point for its simplicity and expressivity. An overview of the syntax, semantics and typing rules is to be found in the appendix.


To begin to explore these questions this work has taken two directions. The first looks at general approaches to deal with control/ownership for session types. The second looks at analysing properties of the type system, especially linearity and how it is used to guarantee session safety, separately from the format of the typing rules. Both are described below.

\subsection{Other Activities}
\label{sec:Activities}

As part of the third year of PhD, various additional activities have been undertaken, such as attending conferences, ABCD group meetings of various sizes, seminars and talks(e.g. The Scottish programming language seminar series, FATA seminars) which improved my knowledge of the field and gave me some insight of the exciting research ongoing. Notably, I have attended the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School\footnote{https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer17/}
which was a great opportunity to learn more about programming languages, from  foundational work on semantics and type theory to advanced program verification techniques; and had a big impact on the direction my research has taken since.

% I plan on attending the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School\footnote{https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer17/} from 23 June to 8 July.
